# Heart Disease Prediction System 🫀

## 📌 Project Overview
This is an End-to-End Machine Learning Web Application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical details.

The system uses a **Logistic Regression** model trained on the **Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset**. The application is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-time Prediction:** Users can input medical parameters (Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc.) and get instant results.
* **Interactive Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
* **Data Analysis:** Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize correlations and distributions (available in the notebook).
* **Accuracy:** The model achieves approximately **80% accuracy** on the test dataset.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python** (Core Language)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
* **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
* **Streamlit** (Web Interface)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## 📂 Project Structure
* `app.py`: The main Streamlit application script.
* `heart_disease_model.sav`: The trained Machine Learning model (serialized).
* `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, EDA, and model training logic.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
* `heart.csv`: The dataset used for training.



## 🎓 Acknowledgments
This project was developed as the **Final Year Project** for the **Big Data Analytics** course offered by **NAVTTC** at the **Institute of Business Administration (IBA)**.
